        <h1>ðŸ‘‹ About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I'm <strong>Ashraful Islam Tutul</strong>, a Computer Science major with a Data Science minor at Truman State University, maintaining a <strong>perfect 4.0 CGPA</strong>. I'm also an active member of the <strong>Google Developer Student Club (GDSC)</strong>, where I engage with innovative tech communities and like minded learners.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey in tech began in childhood, tinkering with basic websites using HTML and CSS. After coming to the U.S., I rekindled that passion and dove deep into full stack web development. Iâ€™ve mastered <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>Git</strong>, and built a full fledged lost and found web app called <strong>TruFind</strong>, used on campus.
        </p>
        <p>
          I bring more than just technical skills I have <strong>four years of experience</strong> managing my father's large business in Bangladesh as the <strong>Managing Director</strong>, handling daily operations, customer service, accounting, logistics, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, I love <strong>cooking</strong>, <strong>traveling</strong>, and <strong>content creation</strong>. Iâ€™ve been passionate about vlogging since 2017. After a pause, Iâ€™m now back as a regular YouTube creator at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ashrafatlantic" target="_blank"><strong>Ashraf Beyond the Atlantic</strong></a>, where I share my journey and experiences abroad.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stay involved on campus too. I work as a photographer for the <strong>Truman Index</strong>, help organize events through the <strong>Muslim Student Association</strong>, and actively participate in <strong>ACM</strong>, <strong>Cricket Club</strong>, and <strong>Soccer Club</strong>. Iâ€™ve held several hands-on roles at Truman including painting, cleaning, room setup, and overnight monitoring.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm always building, always learning, and always looking for ways to improve lives through code and creativity.
